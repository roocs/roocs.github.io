ROOCS is a project to develop data services in support of the [Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)](https://climate.copernicus.eu/). Led by the STFC [Centre for Environmental Data Analysis](https://www.ceda.ac.uk),
ROOCS is providing a collection of tools to provide *data-aware* processing services
of climate projections from CMIP5 and CORDEX.

The main focus of the service is to reduce the volumes of data transferred by providing
*data-reduction* processes that can be invoked directly from the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS).

The **aim of this portal** is to provide a set of links to the services/tools provided by ROOCS.
