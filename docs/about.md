# 🧊 About the Project

We provide **data-aware processing services** for climate projections such as **CMIP6** global datasets, integrated into the [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/).

These services support scalable, efficient access and transformation of large climate datasets, enabling downstream applications and research.
