ROOCS is a project to develop data services in support of the [Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)](https://climate.copernicus.eu/). ROOCS is providing a collection of tools to provide *data-aware* processing services
of climate projections from CMIP6, CMIP5, CORDEX and ATLAS.

The main focus of the service is to reduce the volumes of data transferred by providing
*data-reduction* processes that can be invoked directly from the [C3S Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/).

The **aim of this website** is to provide a set of links to the services and tools provided by ROOCS.
